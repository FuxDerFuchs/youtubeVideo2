currently godot does not give us access to the unshaded view ( which is necessary to not have to set the light direction by hand)

i have however found a "hack" to make it work  at the cost of losing colors
(you could still use gradiants or different shade of colors but texture might be tricky)




also it is ok to use this in any kind of commercial project just give me credits and let me know about it :)
